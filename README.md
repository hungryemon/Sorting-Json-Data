# Json Sorting & View in Flutter Table

The task is to view match-up in a table where highest win rate person  matches against lowest win rate person. Followed by 2nd highest win rate person vs 2nd lowest win rate person. So I did sort the data where object key was dynamic and showed in a table as the task was given.
